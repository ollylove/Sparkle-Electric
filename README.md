# Sparkle Electric

I originally made this project to practice my new skills in React and Next.js, in particular the routing system provided by Next.js and the
                        ability to switch on and off the dark mode.<br>
                        The homepage is a pixel-perfect conversion of a static design I found online, while for the inner pages I followed my own creativity.
